## Story Frame:

*The most complex app I‚Äôve ever built, I built in 3.5 days, this is how I got locked in @ Fractal Tech.*

- Most devs use AI as a translator (docs ‚Üí answers)
    - when what we need is a sparring partner
    - (what you think you know ‚Üí validated understanding ‚Üí actionable steps to implement code)

## Act 1: The Old Way

- I‚Äôm 4 weeks into learning TypeScript, staring down 5 new technologies in 4 days
    - My first instinct? Ask AI to explain the docs

- In this example although I gave it a link to the docs, I asked it a specific question about just one piece of the high-level overview of these docs.

*"I'm looking at [X documentation]. What does this mean? [Quote something directly]*

</aside>

- Sure sometimes you get pretty results, but these are really just *cute looking cliff‚Äôs notes*.
- This is only an answer collector.

## **Act 2: The Shift**

- Russel posted a transcript of one of his conversations with ChatGPT and I noticed two things:
    - He spent more time on getting a feel for only the high-level overview of the tech
    - He was validating his personal understanding instead of just collecting a handful of answers at a time.
- Using AI as a mirror to compare your mental model against reality is the crucial piece of trying to go through new tech at a fast pace while still retaining the critical information.

**The shift**: I started asking: *'Does my mental model match reality?'*

<aside>

- *"I've read [X] docs [[link to docs]], my goal is [X], before we implement, can you test my mental model? Here's what I think is happening: [your understanding]. Is this correct? If not, explain why‚Äîavoid code examples, focus on concepts. Test my knowledge as we go.*
</aside>

This allowed me to parse what‚Äôs an arbitrary example and what‚Äôs an integral piece to implementing the new tech properly.

- The AI would highlight: *"You're right about X and Y, but you're treating Z as critical when it's just an example. The actual critical piece is W." ‚Üê* this was massively helpful in gaining momentum this week.
</aside>

## Act 3: The Proof

I was able to implement these technologies in less than 4 days. 

- React-Router, Supabase DB, Drizzle ORM, Better-Auth, Vercel AI-SDK

*...in less than 4 days. Supabase was the only tech I‚Äôd touched before this program."*

## Nugget:

*I didn't just build an app‚ÄîI learned **how to learn 10x faster**. And that compounds forever.*
