## Story Frame:

_"The most complex app I’ve ever built, I built in 3.5 days, but that's not the story. The story is how I learned to learn with AI, turning it into a mental model mirror."_

- Most devs use AI as a translator (docs → answers)
  - when what we need is a sparring partner (your thinking → validated understanding → confident action)

## Act 1: The Old Way

- “I’m 4 weeks into learning TypeScript, staring down 5 new technologies in 4 days”

  - “My first instinct? Ask AI to explain the docs”

- Show your prompt: “In this example although I gave it a link to the docs, I asked it about a specific question about just one piece of the high-level overview of these docs.”

<aside>
💡

_"I'm looking at [X documentation]. What does this mean? [Quote something directly]_

</aside>

- Sure sometimes you get pretty results, but these are really just _cute looking cliff’s notes_.
- This is only an answer collector.

## **Act 2: The Shift**

- “Russel posted a clip of one of his conversations with ChatGPT and I noticed how much more time he was spending on validating his understanding instead of just collecting a handful of answers at a time.”

**The shift**: I started asking: _'Does my mental model match reality?'_"

- Show a specific example:
    <aside>
    💡
    
    - *"I've read [X] docs [[link to docs]], my goal is [X], before we implement, can you test my mental model? Here's what I think is happening: [your understanding]. Is this correct? If not, explain why—avoid code examples, focus on concepts. Test my knowledge as we go.*
    </aside>

Another benefit was when trying to parse how much of the example code in docs is arbitrary vs. which bits are critical to getting the library implemented & working. In this case I’m testing my mental model against smaller sections of the docs after covering the high-level overview.

- **The pattern emerges**: Docs are 70% arbitrary examples, 30% critical concepts—but they don't tell you which is which

<aside>
💡

- The AI would highlight: _"You're right about X and Y, but you're treating Z as critical when it's just an example. The actual critical piece is W." ←_ this was massively helpful in gaining momentum this week.
</aside>

- **The breakthrough**: AI becomes a learning accelerator, not a crutch

## Act 3: The Proof

**The results:**
_"With this approach, I implemented:_

- React-Router, Supabase DB, Drizzle ORM, Better-Auth, Vercel AI-SDK

_...in less than 4 days. Supabase was the only tech I’d touched before this program."_

## Nugget:

_"I didn't just build an app—I learned **how to learn 10x faster**. And that compounds forever."_
